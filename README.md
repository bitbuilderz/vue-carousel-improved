# Forked Vue Slick Carousel with active maintaining and fixed issues

Fixed problems:

- slick autoplays in Chrome even if prop autoplay is set to false (https://github.com/gs-shop/vue-slick-carousel/issues/229)
- on mobiles after orientation change carousel is not properly resized
- unwanted animation stop and slider reset when scrolling page on mobiles
